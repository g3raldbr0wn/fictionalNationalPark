# fictionalNationalPark
This static site was created with specific requirements from my instructor while I was studying at NPower. This site is a fictional National Park that I created called Earl Douglass National Park, which is a dinosaur themed park. I used pure HTML and CSS to create this and maybe in the future I will recreate this using flexbox and add some features using JavaScript.
